### Phase 7: Mechanism Validation — completed 2026-07-30 (not yet assigned to a milestone)

**Goal:** Test the two concrete follow-ups flagged by the v1.0 self-audit as unresolved about the natural-order-correspondence result (ring_mass 0.609→0.691) — whether the claimed mechanism actually holds, and whether an unrelated confound (stale sigma) explains part of the improvement instead.
**Depends on:** Phase 6 (uses `NaturallyOrderedGenerator`, `natural_sorted_centers`, the Phase 4 sigma-sweep pattern)
**Requirements:** None yet — this phase predates a formal requirements pass; scoped directly from `.planning/milestones/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`'s tracked backlog.
**Plans:** 2 plans (2 waves, sequential — 07-02 depends on 07-01 per the roadmap's stated experiment order)

Plans:
- [x] 07-01-PLAN.md — Neighbor-locality test (Method B, Jacobian-based): `generator/neighbor_locality.py` + `neighbor_locality_test.py`, 20 fresh random parameter draws + 1 trained-checkpoint supplementary draw
- [x] 07-02-PLAN.md — Sigma re-sweep: `sigma_resweep.py`, same SIGMA_GRID as Phase 4 re-trained against the K=462 natural-order grid, compared side-by-side against Phase 4's K=400 numbers

**Details:**
Two experiments, in this order:
1. **Neighbor-locality test** — does `NaturallyOrderedGenerator`'s output have the property the correspondence-fix mechanism assumes: that list-neighbors (under the radius/center-of-mass ordering) move together more than random pairs when the circuit's parameters are nudged? Method B (Jacobian-based): compute `J = ∂q/∂θ` via autograd at several random parameter draws, compare `cosine_similarity(J[i,:], J[j,:])` for adjacent vs. random index pairs.
2. **Sigma re-sweep** — rerun Phase 4's `sweep.py` pattern (same `SIGMA_GRID`, same resumable-checkpoint structure) against the K=462 natural-order grid instead of the old K=400 grid, to check whether sigma=0.1 is still the best choice or whether the never-re-swept bandwidth was masking/inflating the correspondence fix's apparent benefit.

Not yet assigned to a v1.1 or later milestone — added directly to the roadmap per owner's explicit `/gsd:add-phase` request, continuing phase numbering from v1.0 rather than restarting at 1.

**Results (measured, not interpreted — owner's job per this repo's CLAUDE.md):**
- Neighbor-locality: pooled test **fails** the locked two-condition bar (`mean_diff=0.0096` vs. `min_effect=0.10`; p=0.00835 clears significance alone but the effect size doesn't). 13/20 draws individually show the expected direction. Trained checkpoint also fails (`mean_diff=0.0402`).
- Sigma re-sweep: K=462 argmax is still sigma=0.1 (`ring_mass=0.7145`) — no other tested sigma beats it. Same bandwidth already used for every reported K=462 result.
- Owner interpretation pending in both `results/phase7_*_summary.md` files.

No milestone currently in progress; Phase 7 added ahead of milestone scoping. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to formally scope v1.1 around it, or continue ad hoc.
